/**
 Position options to draw the bezier paths.
 
 `right` Draws a bezier path vertically on the right side of a view.
 - If **curveType** is `corner`, it draws a rounded rectangle corner on topRight and bottomRight of a view.
 - If **curveType** is `oval`, it draws an oval-based bezier path vertically on the right side of a view.
 
 `left` Draws a bezier path vertically on the left side of a view.
 - If **curveType** is `corner`, it draws a rounded rectangle corner on topLeft and bottomLeft of a view.
 - If **curveType** is `oval`, it draws an oval-based bezier path vertically on the left side of a view.
 
 `top` Draws a bezier path horizontally on the top side of a view.
 - If **curveType** is `corner`, it draws a rounded rectangle corner on topRight and topLeft of a view.
 - If **curveType** is `oval`, it draws an oval-based bezier path horizontally on the top side of a view.
 
 `bottom` Draws a bezier path vertically on the bottom side of a view.
 - If **curveType** is `corner`, it draws a rounded rectangle corner on bottomRight and bottomLeft of a view.
 - If **curveType** is `oval`, it draws an oval-based bezier path horizontally on the bottom side of a view.
 
 `horizontalSides` Draws an oval-based bezier path vertically on the right & left sides of a view.
 - Can only be applied when **curveType** is `oval`.

 `verticalSides` Draws an oval-based bezier path horizontally on the top & bottom sides of a view.
 - Can only be applied when **curveType** is `oval`.

 `all` Draws a bezier path on all sides of a view.
 - If **curveType** is `corner`, it draws rounded rectangle corners in topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft and bottomRight.
 - If **curveType** is `oval`, it draws a full oval shape out of the view.
